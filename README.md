# ExpressAPI

This is a RESTful API simulation of a blog   

It can be tested using any API development platform such as postman and insomnia.   


The development was done only using Javascript, specifically Node.js and its libraries for the backend mainly Express.js.

Express.js s a back end web application framework for Node.js, it is designed for building web applications and APIs.

All responses are returned in JSON format. Some API endpoints request a token to access them.

1. Create user (Register).
2. login the system and get a token.
3. View user by id.

6. Create a post.
7. view one post by id.
9. update a post.
11. delete a post.
